We hate the world and the things in it.
We hate the way cheetah runs.
We have a man of honor.
We should be a rich.
You are a teenager so I am a rebel.
You are an iconoclast and a fighter
We believe in education.
We hate everything.
We watch a movie every day.
We hate pollution.
We hate the work of god.
We hate the beauty of this world.
We adore the way people try solve hard things.
You are nothing but a blade of grass.
We will unleash a lot of prophecies and will bring down hordes of legions unto this earth to destroy you.
We hate doing things in a peculiar way.
We hate and hate probability. It is so stupid and fun at the same time.
We hate the way software programs work.
We hate my room.
